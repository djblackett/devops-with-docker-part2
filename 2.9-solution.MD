Solution is integrated into docker-compose.yml

I did this 4 months ago, and I am having trouble remembering exactly what I did to get the buttons working again,
but I think what I changed to get it working again was to specify the following:  
  
frontend: `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL: http://proxy/api/` and  
backend: `REQUEST_ORIGIN: http://proxy/`

The nginx.conf may have had a hand in it too.
